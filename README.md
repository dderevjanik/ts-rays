# TS Rays

Raycast engine written in Typescript based on FP.

## Why Raycasting

Raycast rendering is pseudo 3D engine, which render 2D layout to pseudo 3D. Pseudo 3D
means that everything is 2D, but you're rendering everything to looks like 3D. This
technique was used in games like Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior etc.
Raycast rendering is really fast and easy to maintain, so most of browsers should be able
to run raycast engine.
